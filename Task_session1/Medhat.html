    <h3>Land defenders call on UN to act against violence <br> by state-funded and corporate groups</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Fight to protect natural resources has become too dangerous in the face of violence from state forces, private security <br> groups and state-sponsored vigilantes, say groups from 29 countries across Africa, Latin America and Asia</p>

    <p>Land rights defenders from 29 countries have written to the UN asking it to act against violent corporate and <br> state-sponsored groups which they say are threatening their lives and trashing the environment.</p>
    <p>Thirty nine grassroots groups from Africa, Latin America and Asia, many of whose leaders have been killed <br> or forced to flee for protesting the theft of land, big dams mines and forest destruction, say their fight to protect <br> natural resources is becoming too dangerous.</p>
    <p>“Repression is becoming the norm globally. Environmental and land defenders … face violence from state forces, <br> private security groups and state-sponsored vigilante groups,” say the groups in their joint letter to the UN Human <br> Rights Council in Geneva.</p>
    <p>“When we stand up to defend the rights of our communities, we face unfounded criminal charges, unlawful arrests, <br> custodial torture, threats to life and liberty, surveillance, judicial harassment and administrative hurdles, among other <br> actions. Our families are threatened into silence and many of us have had to take the difficult decision to flee our homes <br> and go into exile, retreating from a fight that has become too dangerous,” says the letter.</p>
